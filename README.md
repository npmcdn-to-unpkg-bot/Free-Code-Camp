# My Work

This repository is a record of the work I have done while doing Free Code Camp. I have uploaded my solutions as well as the problem statements. I have saved my solutions and have re-worked some problems as my knowledge of JS has advanced over time. 

I wanted to upload this in order to help people taking the Free Code Camp course when they are looking for improved code solutions. 

I am always looking to improve my code and contiune to grow my knowledge of JS so please feel free to contact.

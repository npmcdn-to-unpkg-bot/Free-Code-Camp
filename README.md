#My Work

This repository is a record of the work I have done while doing Free Code Camp. I have uploaded my solutions as well as the problem statements. I have saved my solutions and have re-worked some problems as my knowledge of JS has advanced over time. 

I wanted to upload this in order to help people taking the Free Code Camp course when they get stuck. I know I have been grateful to https://github.com/Rafase282  and  many others on reddit or the chat room for help when I got stuck on a problem or looking back and coming up with better code.

I am always looking to improve my code and contiune to grow my knowledge of JS so please feel free to contibute to the repo.
